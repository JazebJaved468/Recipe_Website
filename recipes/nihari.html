    <h3>What is Nihari?</h3>
    <p>Nihari is a rich, slow-cooked meat stew flavored with spices and thickened with atta, or Pakistani & Indian-style durum whole wheat flour. Pakistani versions of Nihari are typically made with beef, but Nihari can be made with lamb, goat meat, or chicken.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>slow-cooked meat</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Beef shank</li>
        <li>Garnish</li>
        <li>Garlic Ginger</li>
        <li>Atta</li>
        <li>Nihari Masala</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the onions & meat. Deeply brown onions (refer to the video rather than the pic for reference) give flavor, body, and depth to Nihari. Like with most stews, searing the meat so that it browns is essential, but don’t sear for too long as it can lead to tough meat.</li>
        <li>Bloom Spices. Add spices and allow them to cook in the hot oil. If you’re worried about them burning, you can always add a splash of water.</li>
        <li>Cook. For stovetop, allow it to come to a boil before lowering the heat to a simmer. For slow cooker, transfer the mixture to a slow cooker, add water and mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Thicken. If you try to thicken the gravy by adding in flour, it will result in clumps. To avoid this, remove some of the nihari liquid (I always found using water dilutes the taste) and allow it to cool. Then stir it into the atta flour. Add this slurry to the nihari while stirring to prevent clumps. Allow this to cook and thicken.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>HOW TO GET THE OIL (TARI) ON TOP OF NIHARI</h4>
    <p>Once a curry is cooked, the fats and oil naturally surface to the top. Typically with Nihari, the oil releases once meat has cooked and also once the atta is cooked. Since I don’t use as much oil as some traditional recipes, it won’t appear as oily as most restaurant Niharis.</p>
    <p>To the get oil to rise to top, allow to simmer uncovered on low heat for 5 minutes after you’re done cooking. You can also either reserve oil before adding the atta or add a tarka (tempering of oil) with spices to give Nihari its distinct layer of oil on top.</p>
